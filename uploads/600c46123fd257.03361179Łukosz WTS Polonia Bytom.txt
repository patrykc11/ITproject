My name is Patryk Cebo. I don't have a proposed nickname. I am not sure yet, but me and Mateusz Grzegorczyk would like to make some changes
in our project from SM (Microprocessor Systems) which is a control system for an automated garage. Our idea is to expand this project by adding web or mobile app which 
would communicate by internet. Our expanded project would activate alert system if movement is detected. It could have live stream from cameras. It is our
proposition for this moment, but we haven't finished yet a primary version of project. If we come up with better idea, we will sure let you know as soon as possible.
